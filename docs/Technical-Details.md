## Building on top of the SharedStreets API

This web application relies on the [SharedStreets JS library](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-js) for map matching.

## UI Technical Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This project also makes heavy use of [Redux](https://redux.js.org), a state container for web applications.

## Upcoming development

- Selecting streets by name
- Bulk data input
- Finer-grained data viewing

## Future development
- Pluggable output formats
